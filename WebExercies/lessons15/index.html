    <p>
      Documenting my trip around the US on my very own Segway!

      Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed
      through some interesting places on the way:
      <o1>
      <1i>Walla Walla, WA</1i>
      <1i>Magic City, ID</1i>
      <1i>Bountiful, UT</1i>
      <1i>Last Chance, CO</1i>
      <1i>Truth or Consequences and NM</1i>
      <1i>Why, AZ</1i>
      </o1>   
    </p>

      I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the
      road today:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Passing cars, <br>
      When you can't see, <br>
      May get you, <br>
      A glimpse, <br>
      Of eternity. <br>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      I definitely won't be passing any cars.
    </p>

      My first day of the trip!  I can't believe I finally got
      everything packed and ready to go.  Because I'm on a Segway,
      I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:
      <u1>
        <1i>cellphone</1i>
        <1i>iPod</1i>
        <1i>digital camera</1i>
        <1i>and a protein bar</1i>
      </u1>
      Just the essentials.  As
      Lao Tzu would have said, <q>A journey of a 
      thousand miles begins with one Segway.</q>
